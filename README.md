| 🔴 [Jammming Spotify App](https://github.com/mimcmahon20/Jammming-Spotify-Playlists) | My first React App I learned about state management, API requests, props, and much more. The app allows users to search for songs, add them to a playlist, add their most listened to songs, and add the playlist to their library.
