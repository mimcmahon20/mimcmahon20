## Projects

| 📛 Name      | 📎 Description | ⚛️ Languages | 
| ----------- | ----------- | :-----------: |
| 🟤 [Portfolio](https://github.com/mimcmahon20/My-Portfolio) | A collection of my best programming work using React and GSAP to handle animations. | React, GSAP, HTML, CSS |
| 🔴 [McFlix](https://github.com/your-username/McFlix) | Experience the magic of McFlix, a Netflix clone that brings your favorite movies and TV shows to your screen. Explore various genres and enjoy smooth animations. Future plans include enhancing user interactions and optimizing animations. | React, GSAP, HTML, CSS |
| 🟠 [Jammming Spotify App](https://github.com/mimcmahon20/Jammming-Spotify-Playlists) | My first React App I learned about state management, API requests, props, and much more. The app allows users to search for songs, add them to a playlist, add their most listened to songs, and add the playlist to their library. Note: This app requires access to be added in the backend for Spotify's API. If you'd like to try it reach out! | React, HTML, CSS |
| 🟡 [Snake meets Djikstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/mimcmahon20/snake) | A combination of a Djikstra's pathfinding algorithm and the classic game Snake. The snake attempts to avoid its tail and the walls while collecting food thus extending its body. Currently, the snake is able to survive until it surrounds itself and loses vision of the food. | JS, HTML, CSS |
| 🟢 [Ecosystem Simulation](https://github.com/mimcmahon20/Ecosystem) | An ecosystem with wolves as the predator, bunnies as the prey, evolution, breeding, and more! 3D visualization. | JS, P5.js |
| 🔵 [Smart Rockets](https://github.com/mimcmahon20/Genetic-Algorithm) | A genetic algorithm rocket simulator built using the p5.js library. The simulator allows rockets to navigate obstacles and borders to find the target. Users can interact with the simulation through HTML elements to control parameters and observe the evolution of the rockets. | JS, p5.js |
| 🟣 [P5.js Art & Simulations](https://editor.p5js.org/mimcmahon20/sketches) | My collection of sketches drawn using Processing, specifically P5.js. Most are inspired by The Coding Train's [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and coding tutorials. | JS |
